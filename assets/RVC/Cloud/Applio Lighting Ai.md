## </u>Introduction</u>
- Lighting.Ai is a cloud platform for using AI apps, powered by virtual machines with powerful GPU's.     

- It's a great alternative for training RVC voice models through the cloud, since it has the best GPUs with tons of VRAM.

- Lighting doesn't have the best GPU hours but it does have the best GPUs out of all the other cloud options.

## Using Applio   
###### ‎   
#### 1. Open the Gardio link.
a. To access Applio's UI click on the link next to `Running on public URL:`, after that it is basically the same as using Applio locally or on other cloud platforms.

#### 2. Accessing Files.
b. To upload a dataset, upload audio or anything else find the `Teamspace Drive` button on the right and click it.

!!!
The path to Applio is `Studio > this_studio > Applio > Applio`
!!!

c. Once you're there you can just drag and drop files.

d. To download files click on the file then click the three dots on the right of it and click download

#### 3. Opening the Tensor Board.

a. Find the Tensor board icon on the right side bar and click it.

<img src="../lighting.ai/10.png" alt="image" width="500">‎

b. Once you've done that it will open the Tensor board. To learn how to use it go <u>[here](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/rvc/resources/epochs-tensorboard/#usage-guide)</u>
***

#### 4. Opening the notebook.

a. If you want to go back to the notebook simply click on the `Jupyter` icon on the right.

## How to use Better GPUs    
###### ‎   
#### 1. Swapping GPUs.
a. To swap GPUs go to the GPU icon the the righ and click it. 

<img src="../lighting.ai/11.png" alt="image" width="500">‎

b. Then click on `GPU` and it will show you a list of GPUs you can use by clicking on them and then clicking request.

<img src="../lighting.ai/12.png" alt="image" width="500">‎

!!! Here is a list of how long you can use each GPU before running out of hours.
- 22 hours monthly of T4 16gb
- 21 hours monthly of L4 24gb
- 8 hours monthly of A10G 24gb
- 6 hours monthly of L40 48gb
