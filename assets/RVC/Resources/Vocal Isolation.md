## Introduction :icon-book:
:::     
- A vocal isolation app is a software designed to extract a person's vocals from an audio file, usually through the use of AI models.

- They can remove undesired noises, like background noise, reverb, echo, music, etc.    

- The goal is to get an audio sample with clean vocals, which is what RVC needs to give the most accurate & quality results.

- For RVC users, the best app is Ultimate Vocal Remover 5 (or **UVR**). It can be used either <u>[locally](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/extra/glossary/#local-running)</u> or through the <u>[cloud](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/rvc/resources/vocal-isolation/#cloud-uvr-)</u>.

- If you want to remove noise manually to avoid ai artifacts you can use RX 11, which is mentioned in this guide.

## Local UVR
!!!warning 
*You'll require great specs & GPU to run it effectively. Otherwise, use either the <u>[google colab version](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/rvc/resources/vocal-isolation/#cloud-uvr)</u> or the hugging face space.*

### Installation :icon-download:
*** 
1. Go to their <u>[official website</u>](https://ultimatevocalremover.com/) & press `Download UVR`. And if you want to use BS Roformer you are going to need to install [this](https://github.com/TRvlvr/model_repo/releases/download/uvr_update_patches/UVR_Patch_4_14_24_18_7_BETA_full_Roformer.exe).

    <img src="../uvrmvsep-img/1.jpg" alt="image" width="" height="auto">

###### ‚Äé 
2. It will redirect you their GitHub page. Click the download link for your **operating system**.   
UVR is available both on **Windows & Mac**.
***
###### ‚Äé 
3. Once the installer finishes downloading, execute it & follow the instructions.     
Make sure to tick `üóπ Create a desktop shortcut` for an easier access to UVR.

#### 1. Input audio.        
###### ‚Äé  
- Click `Select input` to select your audio/s. Or just drag the files to it.  
‚Äé   
- In `Select output` you can define the folder for the results.

‚Äé 
#### 2. Select FLAC & GPU Conversion.
###### ‚Äé  
a. At the right you can select the output format.       
We recommend picking `FLAC`. Learn why <u>[here](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/extra/glossary/#lossless-formats)</u>.   
‚Äé  
b. If your GPU is **compatible with <u>[CUDA](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/extra/glossary/#cuda)</u>**, toggle `GPU Conversion` on for a faster process.

### Troubleshooting :icon-tools:

***

==- *A model isn't there.*
###### ‚Äé 
- Click the wrench (üîß) on the left & go to `Download Center`
- Select the category of the model (MDX-NET or VR)
- Unfold its dropdown & select the model that you need
- Then click the download button (üì•). The model will download, which will take a few minutes
===

==- *UVR extracted too little/too much.*
###### ‚Äé
- Modify the `Aggression Setting` value on the right. 
- This determines the **depth** of the extraction. Only the **VR** method has it.
- A higher value will deepen the extraction, and a lower one will soften it.
- Each audio is different, so you'll have to test the ideal value.
===

==- *I can't remove some of the backing vocals.*
###### ‚Äé
- Run the audio through BVE. Modify the <u>[Aggression Setting](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/rvc/resources/vocal-isolation/#uvr-extracted-too-little-too-much)</u> if necessary.
===

==- *I couldn't find my answer.*

### Important Notes ‚Äé :icon-alert:
***
- MVSEP is a website for isolating vocals, that works similarly as UVR.

- The <u>[UVR Colab](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/rvc/resources/vocal-isolation/#cloud-uvr)</u> is much faster & convenient for this task. Use MVSEP if you run out of GPU runtime or feel lazy to convert your audio to WAV.

- For free users, you can't convert audios in batches or longer than 10 minutes. If that's your case, trim it into different pieces.

###### ‚Äé 
### Troubleshooting ‚Äé :icon-tools:
***
==- *MVSEP extracted too much/too little.*
###### ‚Äé 
- Using the **Separation Type** of `DeNoise by aufr33`, you can modify the `Aggressiveness`. 
This determines the depth of the extraction.
- A higher value will deepen the extraction, and a lower one will soften it.
- Each audio is different, so you'll have to test the ideal value.
===

==- *I can't remove some of the backing vocals.*
###### ‚Äé 
- Try running the audio through MelBand Karaoke or BVE. Modify the Aggression Setting if necessary.
===

==- *I couldn't find my answer.*
###### ‚Äé   
- Report your issue <u>[here](https://docs.ai-hub.wtf/rvc/#contributions)</u>.
